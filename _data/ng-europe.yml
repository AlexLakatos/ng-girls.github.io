  bio: "<p>
First time participating as a mentor for an Angular workshop, thanks a lot Robert Willemelis. </p><p>
Female, male, white, black, blue, green or purple, I don't care. For me anyone who shares the same passion as me is welcome.</p><p>
I have grown up contributing to open source not knowing who is contributing, never caring about the person, but caring about the contribution.</p><p>
Anyway I learnt a lot at from @sarahd0ran, at the AngularConnect (2015 unconf), how important it is to make girls-only events.</p><p>
So I want to be part of the ng-girls to contribute to it   
As a close friend of mine says  : 'We really are all Same Same but Different'. 
Let's have fun :)</p>

  name: "Robert"
  surname: "Willemelis"
  bio: "<p>The last years I’ve learned how great diversity can be. I was in some conferences with big diversity support
   (like jsunconf and craft conf). I met a lot of clever female developer and speaker from which know-how I was
   impressed and learned. And I think there are a lot more outside and a lot more who have the talent.
   So it is important to support them.</p>
   <p>As Shmuela asked for that, I decided within in 30s that it would be an honor to do that.</p>
   <p>There are several projects with an impressive diversity support and very good material.<p>
   <p>And last but not least I’m still reading the book of Software craftsmanship by Sandro Mancuso
   in which he shows how important and good it can be to give something back to the community and how important
   it is to learn from other developers. And I think I could also learn as a mentor from the participants.</p>
